# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis 

The purpose of this project is to provide a webpage to display UFO sightings data using dynamic filters. 
As a result of this webpage, the user will be able to filter UFO data on: Date, City, State, Country and Shape of the UFO.  
The webpage uses a combination of css, js and html files to create a user-friendly interface for quick search results. 

## Results

The user can search for specific criteria in 3 easy steps. 

1. To open the webpage, the user will right click in the HTML file to open with an internet browser.

## Summary and Drawbacks

- The website could be more user friendly if it allowed certain date ranges, instead of searching for a specific date. The specific date may limit the user. 

- The website could also be helpful if there was an option to export the data in a CSV file. The data is already in a data table, so being able to export the data table would make the website even better!
